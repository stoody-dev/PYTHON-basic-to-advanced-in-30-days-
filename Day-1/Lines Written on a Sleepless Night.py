from re import I

 I’m unfamiliar with statistics,
I wouldn’t know what to do
With a book on Mathematics
Or a girl of ninety-two.

I really can’t tell the difference
Between a man from Kalamazoo
And the kind of endangered species
That you only find in a zoo.

I’m hopeless at Nuclear Physics-
Don’t ask me to make you a bomb-
But if you would like me to bake you a cake,
I’ll do it with great aplomb.

I’m not very good at book-keeping,
My accounting, they say, is too lax.
I can’t trace my Income, or, credit my debit,
So how can I pay Income Tax?

I’m really not bad at prognosis,
Consult me- I won’t take a fee
I’ll soon let you know if your calcium is low
Or if it’s just Housemaid’s Knee.

I’m not very good with a Nurse
And I feel more at ease writing verse-
I am inclined to convulse when she feels for my pulse,
And if I feel hers, she gets terse!

I’m hopeless at counting those sheep-
I’d rather be off with Bo-peep!
If she’d leave them alone
And take me straight home
I wouldn’t mind losing more sleep.

-By Ruskin Bond
